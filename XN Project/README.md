For our XN capstone project, we worked collaboratively with our industry sponsor to address a real-world business challenge by applying the analytical, technical, and strategic concepts we developed throughout the program. As a team, we began by immersing ourselves in the sponsor’s problem context, exploring the data, and identifying the key operational questions that could be addressed through analytics. We then selected the appropriate tools—ranging from statistical analysis and predictive modeling to dashboarding and exploratory data techniques—to uncover insights that could inform tactical and strategic decision-making. This process allowed us to practice the full analytical lifecycle: defining the business need, preparing and analyzing data, building a functional tool, and communicating insights in a meaningful way.

Throughout the project, we focused heavily on bridging technical analysis with leadership, governance, and ethics considerations. We evaluated how data quality, privacy, and organizational processes influence the feasibility and impact of analytical solutions, ensuring our recommendations aligned with responsible data practices. Our final deliverable, a functional analytical tool paired with an executive-level presentation, was designed to translate complex results into accessible, actionable insights for the sponsor. The tool allows decision-makers to explore the data through an interactive dashboard or model, deepening understanding of performance patterns and offering a practical foundation for ongoing analytical work within the organization.

Ultimately, this XN project enabled us to integrate everything we have learned—data preparation, modeling, visualization, research, and communication—into a single, comprehensive engagement. By working directly with a sponsor, we gained experience navigating real organizational constraints, collaborating as a team to shape a coherent analytical narrative, and presenting recommendations that support improved business outcomes. This experience strengthened our ability to design, justify, and deliver data-driven solutions that are both technically sound and strategically valuable.
