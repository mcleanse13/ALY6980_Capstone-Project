For my individual capstone project, I focused on examining how digital tools can strengthen franchise growth strategies and improve operational performance. I proposed exploring the ways customer relationship management (CRM) systems, predictive analytics, dashboards, and other digital technologies can help franchises like Big Sky Franchise Team make more informed, data-driven decisions. My goal was to address a key challenge many franchises face: the struggle to fully leverage technology because of issues related to data governance, integration, security, and ethical use. By analyzing these barriers and proposing a structured technological framework, I aimed to highlight how digital transformation can enhance franchisee support, streamline operations, and uncover new growth opportunities.

In developing this proposal, I reviewed academic research, industry case studies, and real-world examples that illustrate how digital tools support decision-making, operational efficiency, and long-term organizational success. This included examining CRM adoption, dashboard design, predictive modeling, and the impact of flexible work practices and digital platforms on franchise systems. I also outlined a detailed methodology that incorporates survey data from franchise stakeholders, predictive analytics, A/B testing, and business intelligence dashboarding to evaluate technology effectiveness. Through this mixed-method approach, I aimed to produce both quantitative and qualitative insights that could guide Big Sky Franchise Team in refining its digital strategy.

Ultimately, my project proposes a multi-phased implementation plan that starts with data collection and analysis, moves into pilot testing in select franchise locations, and concludes with a full-scale rollout supported by continuous feedback. By emphasizing leadership, data governance, ethics, and user-centered design, I argue that franchises can adopt digital tools responsibly while maximizing their value. This proposal serves as an extension of the group project and demonstrates how Big Sky Franchise Team can leverage modern analytics to strengthen decision-making, increase franchisee satisfaction, and drive sustainable long-term growth.
