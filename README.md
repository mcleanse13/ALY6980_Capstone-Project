ALY 6980 Capstone Course

In ALY 6980, I completed a comprehensive end-to-end capstone experience designed to apply the full range of analytical, technical, and strategic skills developed throughout my program. As part of an XN-sponsored group project, my team partnered directly with an industry sponsor to solve a real business challenge using data-driven methods. We collaborated to design and deliver a functional analytical tool—built as an interactive dashboard and supported by exploratory data analysis—to help the sponsor extract insights, evaluate performance patterns, and make tactical and strategic decisions. Across multiple drafts, we refined our work based on faculty feedback and presented our findings in a professional 10-minute presentation, ensuring our tool was intuitive, actionable, and aligned with the sponsor’s operational needs.

In parallel with the group project, I developed an individual capstone proposal that extended our sponsor work by focusing on the broader role of digital tools in franchise operations. My proposal explored how CRM systems, predictive analytics, and data governance frameworks can strengthen franchise growth strategies and operational performance. I analyzed leadership considerations, ethical implications, and governance challenges, and proposed a multi-phase implementation plan supported by data collection strategies, survey design, benchmarking practices, and predictive modeling. This allowed me to demonstrate advanced analytics competencies while articulating how digital transformation can improve franchise decision-making, scalability, and long-term success.

Together, these two projects allowed me to integrate the program’s essential learning outcomes—technical proficiency, ethical and governance awareness, strategic decision-making, and clear communication. By building functional tools, conducting applied research, and translating insights for real stakeholders, I strengthened my ability to deliver meaningful analytical solutions in organizational settings.
